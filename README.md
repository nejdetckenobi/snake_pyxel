# Starving Snake

## What is it?
This is a snake clone. 
But it's a bit trickier. 
In this version, you can move through the edges of the playground.
If you hit a wall, the snake will just stop. 
In that case, if you press a key to change its direction, the game will continue.
Your food level depletes. The snake should eat something before the frame reaches to zero.

Use a computer. Not a phone. I couldn't make it work on mobile devices yet.
